Unit 5 Trivia Game - Basic Option of the Unit5/jQuery Homework - A simple interactive trivia game that runs in the web browser.

## Getting Started

This is a fun and interactive trivia game that runs in your web browser.  I simply started with the Star Wars theme, because I always have random trivia about the Original Star Wars Extended Universe bouncing around in my head, and I actually had a list of questions I had previously been planning to us on an in class activity, so I just updated those to make it multiple choice.  It was coded in such a way that I can easily change the questions or add more to the list.

### Prerequisites

The only thing you need to enjoy the fun of the game is a web browser.

```
Web Browser - Google Chrome Preferred
