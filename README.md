# Trivia Game - Star Wars
##### Homework Assignment 5: Basic Quiz - Timed Form

This is a fun and interactive trivia game that runs in your web browser, it is the Basic Version of the Unit 5 Homework covering JavaScript & jQuery.  (The Advanced assignment can be found on my [Portfolio](https://sasquatchxyz.github.io/Basic-Portfolio/)).  The game was styled with Basic CSS (no templates), simply so that I could expand my practice.  I started with the Star Wars theme simply because I always have random trivia about the Original Star Wars Extended Universe bouncing around in my head, and I actually had a list of questions I had previously been planning to use in a class activity, so I just updated those to make it multiple choice.  It was coded in such a way that I can easily change the questions or add more to the list.
